      To compile using Ant, first edit idea.build.properties as appropriate.

      The 'build' target will create a zip archive suitable for extracting into
      IDEA's plugins directory. The 'deploy' target will unzip the archive into an
      IDEA plugin development sandbox (useful if you want to hack on the plugin).

      Alternatively, just download the zip archive and extract it into IDEA's plugins
      directory. On a Mac, this directory is located at ~/Library/Application Support/IntelliJIdea90.
