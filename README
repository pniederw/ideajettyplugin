      To compile using ANT, first edit idea.build.properties as appropriate.

      The 'build' target will create a zip archive suitable for extracting into
      IDEA's plug-ins directory. The 'deploy' target will unzip the archive into an
      IDEA plug-in development sandbox (useful if you want to hack on the plug-in).
